# Taiwanese Credit Risk Analysis

**Project was cancelled**

*Issues with the data:*
- Any models created with this particular dataset will be prone to data leakage.
  - the majority of the explanatory variables deal with past payments and past bill amounts, none of which would be available for a new customer
- critical information missing
  - in creating a credit risk profile, one would ideally want to know things of importance about a potential customer such as employment, time of employment, salary, etc


**Goal:** The goal of the project is to explore the data and determine which factors could be used to determine whether a potential customer seeking a loan would default. To make such a determination, a credit risk profile will be created using the information at hand. Using the data, I will create a model to predict the probability of default for a given person.
